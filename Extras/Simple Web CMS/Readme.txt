This is a simple web interface for your Spurious Server, the orginal was done by ElderGod from Emupedia.com, some time around 2007.

This would give you a simple news, faq and account registration page, with links to your forums pages.

This is included for a simple CMS web interface, with credit going to ElderGod for providing it in the first page.

Copy these files to your htdoc or www or whichever folder you need to have your web files in.

Change the database information in the config.php file, things like database name, password and so on.

You will need to change the path in the links in your html files to point to where stats.xsl is being stored for your Spurious server, if you use the default directories, it should be in the ServerFiles\stats directory.  The link will point to the stats.xml file.

I tested this using XAMPP and it worked just fine with it.
